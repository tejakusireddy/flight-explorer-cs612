## Features

*   **Comprehensive Search:** Users can search for flight data using various criteria:
    *   Airlines & Airports by Country Code
    *   Routes flown by a specific Airline (by IATA code)
    *   Detailed Airport Information (including real-time weather) by IATA code
    *   Routes Departing From or Arriving At a specific Airport (by IATA code)
    *   Airlines operating To/From a specific Airport (by IATA code)
    *   Airlines flying directly Between two Airports (by IATA codes)
    *   Calculate geographic Distance between two Airports (by IATA codes)
*   **Interactive Map:** Utilizes Leaflet.js to visually represent airport locations as markers and flight routes as connecting lines. Includes map interactions like zooming, panning, and popups on markers.
*   **Real-time Weather:** Integrates with the Open-Meteo API to display the current day's high and low temperatures when viewing airport details.
*   **Autocomplete Suggestions:** Provides helpful dropdown suggestions for country codes, airline IATA codes, and airport IATA codes as the user types, improving usability and accuracy.
*   **Dynamic UI:** The interface updates cleanly based on user selections and search results, providing feedback via loading indicators and clear error messages.
*   **Responsive Design:** Basic responsiveness implemented using Tailwind CSS for usability on different screen sizes.

## Setup and Running Locally

This project requires Node.js, npm, and a running PostgreSQL instance with the necessary database and tables created and populated (as per CS612 Assignment 1/2 specifications).

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tejakusireddy/flight-explorer-cs612.git
    cd YourRepoName
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Configure Database Connection:**
    *   Copy the example environment file: `cp .env.example .env`
    *   Edit the `.env` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual PostgreSQL connection details (using the variable names **with underscores**, e.g., `PG_USER`, `PG_PASSWORD`).
4.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
5.  **Access the application:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8001`.
